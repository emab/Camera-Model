# Camera-Model
Modelling a Pixy camera in Java

This project is part of a larger goal which is to create a co-model of a blimp with a camera attached.
The camera will be used for localisation. This will be done by finding and recognising objects and then working out its own position relative to the objects.
The camera I'm modelling is the CMUcam5 Pixy. It can recognise objects and returns their ID and pixel coordinates of a box surrounding the object.
I'm modelling this in Java to begin with and will then aim to transfer it to the VDM-RT language when I'm comfortable with my solution.
